Monday Night Football Score Prediction Cleanup Tool

This script identifies and removes score predictions for games that are no longer
considered the actual Monday Night Football game due to the updated detection logic.

The new logic identifies the LATEST game on Monday as the actual MNF game,
not just any game with the is_monday_night flag set to 1.
