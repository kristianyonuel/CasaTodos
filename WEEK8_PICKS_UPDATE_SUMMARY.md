## Tiebreaker Scores (Stored for Manual Processing)

The tiebreaker scores were recorded but not inserted into the database as there's no dedicated tiebreaker table. These may need to be processed manually:

- JAVIER: 30-10
- VIZCA: 24-13  
- ROBERT: 28-14
- COYOTE: 31-17
- JEAN: 31-14
- RAMFIS: 32-20
- GUILLERMO: 42-14
- JONIEL: 35-21
- RADA: 27-15
- RAYMOND: 31-17
- SHORTY: 38-24 (note: original data showed "38--24")
- KRISTIAN: 30-13
- FER: 34-21
- MIKITIN: 38-10 (player not found)

## Action Items

1. ✅ **Week 8 picks updated** - All 13 players have their picks in the database
2. ⚠️ **Add MIKITIN user** - User needs to be created in the database first
3. ⚠️ **Process tiebreaker scores** - Manual entry required (no tiebreaker table found)
4. ✅ **Data validation** - All picks properly mapped to team abbreviations

## Database Impact

- Previous Week 8 picks were cleared and replaced
- KRISTIAN had 13 existing picks that were deleted and replaced
- All picks use proper team abbreviations (LAC, MIN, ATL, etc.)
- Created timestamps are set to current time
