# Season Leaderboard Auto-Update Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified
The season leaderboard wasn't updating with weekly winners after Monday Night Football games completed because:

1. **Missing Automatic Trigger**: The `background_updater.py` was only updating game scores but never called `update_weekly_results()`
2. **Incomplete Weekly Results**: The `weekly_results` table existed but wasn't being populated automatically when games finished

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Background Updater
**File**: `background_updater.py`
- **Added**: `_update_weekly_results()` method to calculate and store weekly winners
- **Modified**: Game update loop to automatically call weekly results update after scores are fetched
- **Result**: Now when games finish, the system automatically determines weekly winners using the 5-tier Monday Night Football tiebreaker system

### 2. Comprehensive Results Fixer
**File**: `fix_season_leaderboard.py`
- **Purpose**: One-time fix to update all past weeks that were missing proper weekly results
- **Action**: Updated Weeks 1-4 (2025) with correct winner calculations
- **Result**: Season leaderboard now shows accurate weekly wins

### 3. Manual Update Tools
**Files**: `manual_update_week4.py`, various test scripts
- **Purpose**: Admin tools to manually trigger weekly results updates when needed

## 🏆 Current Season Standings (Fixed)
1. **kristian**: 2 weekly wins (Weeks 2 & 3)
2. **coyote**: 1 weekly win (Week 1)
3. All others: 0 weekly wins

## 🔄 Automatic Process Going Forward
1. **Background updater runs every 5-30 minutes** (dynamic intervals)
2. **Fetches latest game scores** from ESPN API
3. **Automatically updates weekly results** after score updates
4. **Calculates weekly winners** using Monday Night Football tiebreaker rules
5. **Season leaderboard updates in real-time** showing current weekly win leaders

## 🎮 Monday Night Football Tiebreaker System
When users are tied on regular game wins, the system uses:
1. **Correct MNF Winner** (selected team vs actual winner)
2. **Closest to Total Points** (sum of both team scores)
3. **Closest to Winner Score** (higher scoring team)
4. **Closest to Loser Score** (lower scoring team)
5. **Alphabetical** (final tiebreaker)

## ✅ Status: FIXED
- ✅ Season leaderboard now updates automatically
- ✅ Weekly winners properly calculated and stored
- ✅ Monday Night Football tiebreakers working correctly
- ✅ Background system enhanced for future weeks
- ✅ All historical data corrected (Weeks 1-3)

The season leaderboard will now stay current as games finish!
