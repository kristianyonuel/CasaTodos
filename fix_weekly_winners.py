Fix Weekly Winners in Database
==============================

The downloaded database from the server has incorrect is_winner flags
set by the automated scheduler. This script fixes them to match reality.

Corrections needed:
- Week 7: Remove ROBERT as winner, set RAYMOND as winner  
- Week 8: Remove KRISTIAN as winner (was a tie, no winner)
