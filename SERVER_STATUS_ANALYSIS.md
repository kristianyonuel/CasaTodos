# Server Investigation Results - URGENT

## Current Status (Oct 17, 2025 20:42)

### ✅ GOOD NEWS: App is Running
- Process ID: 332564
- Command: `/usr/bin/python3 /home/casa/CasaTodos/app.py`  
- Started: Oct 14 (running for 3+ days)
- CPU Time: 14:55 (significant usage)

### ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES:

1. **Empty Log File**: app.log is 0 bytes - no logging output
2. **Long-Running Process**: Same process since Oct 14 - might be stuck/zombie
3. **High CPU Usage**: 14:55 CPU time suggests possible infinite loop or heavy processing

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO RUN:

```bash
# Check if the app is actually responding
curl -I http://localhost:5000
# OR
wget --spider http://localhost:5000

# Check what ports are actually open  
ss -tlnp | grep :5000

# Check if process is actually responding (not zombie)
kill -0 332564 && echo "Process responsive" || echo "Process not responding"

# Check process details
ps -fp 332564

# Check if app is stuck in a loop
strace -p 332564 -c -f -e trace=all 2>&1 | head -20

# Check memory usage
cat /proc/332564/status | grep -E "(VmPeak|VmSize|VmRSS)"

# Check what files the process has open
lsof -p 332564 | head -10
```

## LIKELY SCENARIOS:

1. **App is Running but Not Logging**: Logging configuration issue
2. **App is Stuck**: Infinite loop or blocking operation  
3. **App is Running on Different Port**: Not port 5000
4. **Database Lock**: SQLite database locked causing hang

## QUICK DIAGNOSIS:

Run these commands in order and report results:

1. `curl -I http://localhost:5000` - Check if app responds
2. `ps -fp 332564` - Check process details
3. `ls -la nfl_fantasy.db` - Check database file
4. `tail -20 /var/log/syslog | grep python` - System errors

If app is not responding, you may need to:
```bash
sudo kill 332564
cd ~/CasaTodos  
python3 app.py
```
